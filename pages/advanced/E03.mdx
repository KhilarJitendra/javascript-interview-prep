### Async Programming

- **Callbacks**
- **Promises**


## Promises in JavaScript

Promises are a powerful and flexible mechanism for handling asynchronous operations. They provide a cleaner and more structured way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.

A promise represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and can be in one of three states:

- **Pending:** The initial state. The promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.

- **Fulfilled:** The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.

- **Rejected:** The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.


- The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.

- You cannot access the Promise properties state and result.

- You must use a Promise method to handle promises. So 

- Promise.then() takes two arguments, a callback for success and another for failure.

  Both are optional, so you can add a callback for success or failure only.


  ```

    const dataFetch = new Promise(function (res,rej) {


        if(true) {
            res("OK");
        }
        else {
            rej("err")
        }

    });

    console.log(dataFetch.then( () => {
        console.log('fullfilled')
    }, () => {
        console.log("error")
    }))



  ```
