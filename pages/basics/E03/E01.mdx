## E01: JavaScript Objects

### Introduction

When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object. In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

- Booleans, numbers, and strings can be objects if defined with the new keyword.
- Dates, maths, regular expressions, arrays, functions, and objects are always objects.

### Ways to Create Objects

There are different ways to create new objects:

1. Create a single object using an object literal (recommended).
2. Create a single object with the keyword new.
3. Define an object constructor and then create objects of the constructed type.
4. Create an object using Object.create().

### 'this' Keyword

In JavaScript, the `this` keyword is used to refer to the current execution context within which a function is invoked. It refers to an object, and which object depends on how `this` is being invoked.

- In an object method, `this` refers to the object.
- Alone, `this` refers to the global object.
- In a function, `this` refers to the global object.
- In a function, in strict mode, `this` is undefined.
- In an event, `this` refers to the element that received the event.
- Methods like `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` can refer `this` to any object.

### Using Object.values()

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

const myArray = Object.values(person); // Returns [ 'John', 30, 'New York' ]

```

#### Object.defineProperty()

It is considered good practice to name constructor functions with an uppercase first letter. In a constructor function, `this` does not have a value initially, but it becomes the new object when a new object is created.

```javascript
function Person(fn, ln, isFE) {
    this.firstName = fn;
    this.lastName = ln;
    this.isFE = isFE;
}

const obj1 = new Person('Jitendra', 'Khilar', true);
console.log(obj1);

```






## JavaScript Object Prototypes:

All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype. We cannot add a new property to an existing object constructor.

### Prototype Inheritance:

- Date objects inherit from `Date.prototype`.
- Array objects inherit from `Array.prototype`.

Custom properties can be added to `Person.prototype`.

```javascript
function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}

Person.prototype.nationality = "English";

```

## JavaScript Iterables:

Iterable objects are objects that can be iterated over with `for..of`. Technically, iterables must implement the `Symbol.iterator` method. You can use a `for..of` loop to iterate over the elements of a string and array, but not for objects (`for in`).

### JavaScript Iterators:

An iterator is an object that implements the `next` method, which returns the next item in the sequence. Iterators are used in `for..of` loops.

### JavaScript ES5 Object Methods:

#### `Object.keys(object)`

```javascript
const obj = {
    name: 'Jitendra',
    lastName: 'Khilar'
}

console.log(Object.keys(obj)) // [ 'name', 'lastName' ]

```

## JavaScript ES5 Object Methods:

* Object.create()

* Adding or changing an object property: Object.defineProperty(object, property, descriptor)

* Adding or changing object properties: Object.defineProperties(object, descriptors)

* Accessing Properties: Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(object, property)

* Returns all properties as an array: Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object)

* Accessing the prototype: Object.getPrototypeOf(object)

* Returns enumerable properties as an array: Object.keys(object)

* Prevents adding properties to an object: Object.preventExtensions(object)

* Returns true if properties can be added to an object: Object.isExtensible(object)

* Prevents changes of object properties (not values): Object.seal(object)

* Returns true if the object is sealed: Object.isSealed(object)

* Prevents any changes to an object: Object.freeze(object)

* Returns true if the object is frozen: Object.isFrozen(object)

* Change a Property

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  language: "EN"
};

// Change a property
Object.defineProperty(person, "language", { value: "NO" });

```

```
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  language: "EN"
};

Object.defineProperty(person, "language", { enumerable: false });
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(person);  // Returns an array of properties

```
