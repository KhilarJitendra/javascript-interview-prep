### Javascript Objects


When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object:


In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
Dates are always objects
Maths are always objects
Regular expressions are always objects
Arrays are always objects
Functions are always objects
Objects are always objects


There are different ways to create new objects:

Create a single object, using an object literal. - recommended
Create a single object, with the keyword new.
Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
Create an object using Object.create().

* Why 'this' key word - 
 In JavaScript, the this keyword is used to refer to the current execution context within which a function is invoked.
 this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.

In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

In an object method, this refers to the object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.


#### Using Object.values():

```
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

const myArray = Object.values(person); // give array of [ 'John', 30, 'New York' ]

```

```

The result will be a string following the JSON notation:

{"name":"John","age":50,"city":"New York"}


```

#### Object.defineProperty()

The Object.defineProperty() method can also be used to add Getters and Setters:

### JavaScript Object Constructors :

It is considered good practice to name constructor functions with an upper-case first letter.
In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.

```
function Person(fn,ln,isFE) {
    this.firstName = fn,
    this.lastName = "ln",
    this.isFE = "isFE"
}

const obj1 = new Person('Jitendra','Khilar',true);
console.log(obj1);

```

### JavaScript Object Prototypes :

All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype.We can not add a new property to an existing object constructor .

### Prototype Inheritance :

Date objects inherit from Date.prototype
Array objects inherit from Array.prototype

We can add custom add Person.prototype

```
function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}

Person.prototype.nationality = "English";
```

### JavaScript Iterables :

Iterable objects are objects that can be iterated over with for..of.

Technically, iterables must implement the Symbol.iterator method.

You can use a for..of loop to iterate over the elements of a string and array nor for Object (for in);

### JavaScript Iterators :

### JavaScript ES5 Object Methods :

** Object.keys(object)

```
const obj = {
    name: 'Jitendra',
    lastName: 'Khilar'
}

console.log(Object.keys(obj)) // [ 'name', 'lastName' ]

```

// Create object with an existing object as prototype
Object.create()

// Adding or changing an object property
Object.defineProperty(object, property, descriptor)

// Adding or changing object properties
Object.defineProperties(object, descriptors)

// Accessing Properties
Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(object, property)

// Returns all properties as an array
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(object)

// Accessing the prototype
Object.getPrototypeOf(object)

// Returns enumerable properties as an array
Object.keys(object)

// Prevents adding properties to an object
Object.preventExtensions(object)

// Returns true if properties can be added to an object
Object.isExtensible(object)

// Prevents changes of object properties (not values)
Object.seal(object)

// Returns true if object is sealed
Object.isSealed(object)

// Prevents any changes to an object
Object.freeze(object)

// Returns true if object is frozen
Object.isFrozen(object)


//
```
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  language : "EN"
};

// Change a property
Object.defineProperty(person, "language", {value : "NO"});
```

```
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName : "Doe",
  language : "EN"
};

Object.defineProperty(person, "language", {enumerable:false});
Object.getOwnPropertyNames(person);  // Returns an array of properties
```
