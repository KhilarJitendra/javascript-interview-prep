### Conditionals

- **If-Else**
- **Switch**

    Real Life ex - Switch statements are particularly handy when you have a limited number of discrete values to compare and can provide a cleaner and more efficient alternative to multiple if-else conditions.


     ```


    const role = "TDM2";

    let accesMessage = '';


    switch(role) {
        case "admin" :
            accesMessage = "You will have fulll access";
            break
        case "developer" :
            accesMessage = "You will have access only to dev mode";
            break
        case "TDM" :
            accesMessage = "You will have access only to project";
            break
        default : 
            accesMessage = "You will have read access";
    }


    console.log('Message',accesMessage)


     ```

- **While Loop**

Real-Life Example: User Authentication

Imagine you are implementing a user authentication system for a web application. You might use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for their credentials until they enter valid information. The switch statement can be employed to handle different scenarios based on the user input.

Here's a simplified JavaScript example:

```

let isAuthenticated = false;
    let attempts = 3;

    while(attempts > 0 && !isAuthenticated) {

        const username = prompt('Enter your user name:');
        const password = prompt('Enter your password:');



        switch (true) {
            case username === "admin" && password === "admin" :
                isAuthenticated = true;
                alert('You have sucessfully logged in as admin');
                break;
            case username === "user" && password === "user" :
                isAuthenticated = true;
                alert("You have sucessfully logged in as user");
                break;
            default :
                attempts = attempts - 1;
                console.log('Invalid creds, no of attempts left',attempts)
        }
    }


    if(!isAuthenticated) {
        console.log('SITE BLOCKED..',attempts);
    }





```




### Loops

- **For-In**

Use for...in for iterating over the properties of an object.

```
for (let key in object) {
    // code to execute
}
```

- **For-Of**


Use for...of for iterating over the values of an iterable (like arrays, strings, maps, 

```

for (let element of iterable) {
    // code to execute
}

```
